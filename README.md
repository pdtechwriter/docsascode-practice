# Effective API Documentation

Developers often cite **API documentation** as the most important part of an API, yet many organizations that create them don't invest in ensuring their _API documentation experience_ is the best it can be.

Low-quality or outdated API software documentation reflects:

- poorly on the work of your development team
- results in increased support calls

You should aim to develop effective API documentation created to make it easy for developers to work with your API, leaving your software developers time for what they do best-write code
